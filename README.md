# pythonBot
Machine Learning 2021 assignment
# Objective
Bot takes the input(symptoms) from the user and  displays the output(medicines for their symptoms)
# About my chatbot:
We all are facing different types of health problems from major to minor one. We dont go to hospital for every small problem. Most of the medicines for the problems are avalable in our house,But we cant't remember the names for all of them. So this chatbot helps us to find the names of medicines for the problems and gives some precautions. This chatbot is very helpful in firstaid treatment. If the symptoms of the problem worsen or not going at all, it tells the time to admit in the hospital. The bot also tells us the natural remedies to cure the small problems or reduce the symptoms.I used small functions to create the bot.
